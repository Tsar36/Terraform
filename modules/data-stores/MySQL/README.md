MySQL
This folder contains an example Terraform configuration that deploys a MySQL database (using RDS) in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.


Quick start
Terraform modules are not meant to be deployed directly. Instead, you should be including them in other Terraform configurations. See live/stage/data-stores/mysql and live/prod/data-stores/mysql for examples.
