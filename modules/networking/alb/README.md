Application Load Balancer
This folder contains an example Terraform configuration that defines a module for deploying a load balancer (using ELB) in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

For more info, please see Chapter 10, "How to use Terraform as a Team", of Terraform: Up and Running.

Quick start
Terraform modules are not meant to be deployed directly. Instead, you should be including them in other Terraform configurations. See live/stage/networking/alb and live/prod/networking/alb for examples.
